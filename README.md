# SimplyBlackjack

This is a simplified version of a blackjack game. There is only one player and the dealer. The player has to decide to hit until it gets as close as he can to 21, or he can stand.The dealer is going to hit until he gets 21 or close enough. The player is going to be prompted to bet chips, and when the game is done, the result will be shown considering the initial chips and the ones he bet.
